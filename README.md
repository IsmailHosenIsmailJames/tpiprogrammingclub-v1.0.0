# TPI Programming Club
### A Non-profit Open Community Base programming Club.

A project for teach student Programming.

## What's the idea?
Today, when students focusing to learn programming then they feel that Programming tutorial in Bangla is not widely available. If there have any website where we can learn programming in Bangla, it would be the best ever. I unfortunately there have no website where can students Learn programming in Bangla without no cost.
On that case, I decided to build an mobile App and also a website where can be post programming tutorial and share comments, give like etc.
After 45 days with of 4 hours work day I have became successful to do this idea in reality.

## How will work this website and Mobile App?
#### 1. This is a community base website. Anyone can post here on based more than 5 programming languages.
#### 2. After publish any post, latter can be editor or modify.
#### 3. This website and Mobile App has inbuilt Rich text editor. Programming must use this editor. It's hve lot of features.
#### 4. Like, Comment options are available.
#### 5. There have Racking system. Rank will update in every week.
#### 6. If any post seems bad for our community, then it will removed from this website.
#### 7. Learners can run code on web. For simplify this process we have integrate our website with Replit.
